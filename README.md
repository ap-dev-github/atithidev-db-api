# Overview 🔍

## **Atithidev DB API – Scalable & Cost-Optimized Serverless Backend**
> The Atithidev DB API is a scalable, serverless backend solution designed for efficiently managing profiles and reviews. Built using the Serverless Framework and deployed on AWS Lambda, it eliminates infrastructure management while ensuring cost-effective scaling and high availability.

---

## 💰 Cost Efficiency & Scalability
- The API scales down to approximately **zero cost** for up to **1 million API requests per month**.
- If there is no traffic, the infrastructure **automatically scales down** to near-zero cost, inclusive of AWS services like **S3, API Gateway**, and other dependencies.
- When traffic increases, it **seamlessly scales up** using the AWS API Gateway to handle the load.
- After exceeding **1 million requests**, costs are incurred based on **AWS Lambda pricing**.

---

## 🚀 Fully Automated & Cost-Optimized CI/CD Deployment
1. **Run Code Quality Checks** – ESLint for linting and Jest for API endpoint testing.
2. **Automated CI/CD Based Testing & Deployment Optimization**
   - Installs the testing dependencies, runs tests, and removes them post-testing to reduce package size.
   - Prunes old versions from the cloud and **reduces dev dependencies** before packaging.
3. **Deploy to AWS** – Automatically updates the AWS Lambda function and connects with API Gateway.
4. **Verify and Activate Lambda** – Ensures the function is running seamlessly after deployment.
